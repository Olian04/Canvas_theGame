####__Background__
The concept was influenced by the "Giana sisters" main mechanic. 
I really love the idea of changing reality to better suit the situation.
Although after a while of playing around with their(the "Giana Sisters") world shifting mechanic i found my self wanting more.
So i decided to give it a shot my self.
And so Canvas was born.

####__Design__
The design for Canvas originated in in the first thought i had when i started playing around with the world shifting idea, "A platforming puzzle game about playing with colors".
I knew i wanted the game to be 2D, and i quickly realized that i wanted it to be heavy play on colors.
